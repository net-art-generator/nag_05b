The net.art generator automatically produces net.art on demand.

nag_05-this version of the net.art generator creates images. The resulting image emerges as a collage of a number of images which have been collected on the WWW in relation to the 'title' you have chosen. The original material is processed in 12-14 randomly chosen and combined steps. For finding the images, nag_05 draws on Google search; that is the delicate part as Google limits access to their search results for all non-paying clients including net.art projects like this one.

The technical base of the net.art generator is a PERL script, running on apache and debian servers.
