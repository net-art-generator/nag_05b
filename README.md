The net.art generator automatically produces net.art on demand.

nag_05-this version of the net.art generator creates images. The resulting image emerges as a collage of a number of images which have been collected on the WWW in relation to the 'title' you have chosen. The original material is processed in 12-14 randomly chosen and combined steps. For finding the images, nag_05 draws on Google search; that is the delicate part as Google limits access to their search results for all non-paying clients including net.art projects like this one. nag_05, has been out of order for many months: Google, the connected search engine, has changed their terms of use in 2015 and terminated the free access to their search results. In the meantime we have restored nag_05 (nag version 5b) by using a free but very limited offer by Google (100 requests per day).

The technical base of the net.art generator is a Perl script, running on apache and debian servers. For the library version of imagemagick:
v6.9.10.23+dfsg-2.1+deb10u1 and libimage-magick-q16-perl for the Perl (v.5.28.1) interface (as of Oct 2020).

note: Currently, the encoding format is utf-8 for index.cgi. There is also nag_extensions, which is developed and maintained by Gerrit Boelz, displaying a collection of the generated images as thumbnails in a grid and allowing to click on them to open a more detailed view of the image.
